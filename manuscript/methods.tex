\section{Methods}

\subsection{Data}

%B: IMO: The data subsection would be better organized with parts, (1) ploidy, (2) breeding system, (3) tree, (4) models, (5) model selection and statistical inference.
% E: I changed the subsectioning, but to a different arrangement: (1) Data, (2) Models, (3) Statistical inference.  With subsubsections as necessary.

Chromosome number data were obtained for all Solanaceae taxa in the Chromosome Counts Database \citep[CCDB;][]{rice_2015}, and the ca.~14,000 records were curated semi-automatically using the CCDBcurator R package \citep{rivero_2019}.
CCDB contains records from original sources that have multiple complex symbol patterns denoting multivalence, or irregularites of chromosome counts.
After a first round of automatic cleaning, we examined results by hand and corrected records as necessary.
Our hand-curated records were also contrasted against the ploidy dataset from \citet{robertson_2011}, original references therein, and against ploidy data in the C-value DNA dataset from \citet{bennett_2005}.
By comparing three different sources of information, we were able to code taxa as diploid, $D$, or polyploid, $P$.
For the majority of species, ploidy was assigned according to information from the original publications included in the  C-value DNA dataset \citep{bennett_2005}.
For taxa without ploidy information but with information about chromosome number, we assigned ploidy based on the multiplicity of chromosomes within the genus/family, or based on SI/SC classification.
For example, \textit{Solanum betaceum} did not have information about ploidy level but it has 24 chromosomes, so since $x=12$ is the base chromosome number of the genus \textit{Solanum} \citep{olmstead_2007}, we assigned \textit{S.~betaceum} as diploid. 
Additionally, because of the absence of SI polyploids (explained above and below), species known to be SI could be scored as diploid.
Species with more than one ploidy level were assigned the most frequent ploidy level recorded or the smallest ploidy in case of frequency ties.

Breeding system was scored as self-incompatible, $I$, or self-compatible, $C$, based on results curated from the literature and original experimental crosses \citep[as compiled in][]{igic_2006, goldberg_2010, robertson_2011, goldberg_2012}.
Most species could unambiguously be coded as either $I$ or $C$ \citep{raduski_2012}.
Following previous work, we coded any species with a functional SI system as $I$, even if SC or dioecy was also reported.
Dioecious species without functional SI were coded as $C$.
% E: I am trying to stick with I/C when talking about the state values, but using SI/SC when talking about the meaning of the trait (because this what people use normally). 
%R- Okay- I was getting confused as well thanks for clarifying

Resolution of taxonomic synonymy followed Solanaceae Source \citep{solsource}. 
Hybrids and cultivars were excluded because ploidy and breeding system can be affected by artificial selection during domestication.
Following the reasoning outlined in \citet{robertson_2011}, we closely examined the few species for which the merged ploidy and breeding system data indicated the presence of self-incompatible polyploids.
%B: Modified this section for post-review response:
Although SI populations frequently contain some SC individuals, and diploid populations frequently contain some polyploid individuals, in no case did we find convincing data for a naturally occurring SI polyploid population  \citep[discussed in][]{robertson_2011}.
%B rm: The single instance of an SI polyploid individual appears to be an allopentaploid hybrid of \textit{Solanum oplocense} Hawkes x \textit{Solanum gourlayii} Hawkes, reported by \citet{camadro_1981}.
% Under exceedingly rare circumstances, it is possible for polyploids containing multiple copies of S-loci to remain SI, so long as they express a single allele at the S-locus \citep[discussed in][]{robertson_2011}.
Because of the resulting absence of polyploid SI populations, as well as the functional explanation for polyploidy disabling gametophytic SI systems with non-self recognition (see the Introduction), we consider only three observed character states: self-incompatible diploids $(ID)$, self-compatible diploids $(CD)$, and self-compatible polyploids $(CP)$.

Matching our character state data to the largest time-calibrated phylogeny of Solanaceae \citep{sarkinen_2013} yielded 651 species with ploidy and/or breeding system information on the tree.
% FIXME: Rosana will update numbers around here TODO
Of these, 290 had information for both states.
The number of species in each combination of states is summarized in \cref{figure:stateclassifications}A.
We retained all 651 species in each of the analyses below because pruning away tips lacking breeding system in the ploidy-only analyses (and vice versa) would discard data that could inform the diversification models.
A total of 405 taxa without any information about breeding system or ploidy were excluded.
%Tips without trait data might not improve point estimation of diversification parameters while increasing uncertainty in the estimates of trait linked diversification
% R-This is very important but I have removed it because I think it is a full on paper by its own
%Including this many more species would have prohibitively slowed our analyses, especially those implementing the most complex models.

The Supplementary Information contains citations for the numerous original data sources. % FIXME (and say here how many refs?)
The Dryad archive contains the data and tree files used for analyses. % FIXME
% \url{https://github.com/roszenil/solploidy}  E: we should use dryad instead, because github repos are not guaranteed to last

\subsection{Models}

We employed a suite of SSE-style models \citep[BiSSE, MuSSE, HiSSE;][]{maddison_2007, fitzjohn_2012, beaulieu_2016} to test associations between ploidy, breeding system, and lineage diversification.
The full set of models is listed in \cref{table:marginallike}.

\subsubsection{Ploidy and diversification}

In order to investigate the association between ploidy level and diversification, we first defined a binary state speciation and extinction model \citep[BiSSE,][]{maddison_2007} in which taxa were classified as diploid $(D)$ or polyploid $(P)$.
In this $D/P$ ploidy model, the model parameters are speciation rates ($\lambda_D$, $\lambda_P$) and extinction rates ($\mu_D$, $\mu_P$) for each state, and a rate of transition from D to P ($\rho$).
This is the same model \citet{mayrose_2011} used for this question across an array of plant genera.
% R- Itay wanted to hightlight that is the same model. Definitely a BiSSE. He did the ClaSSE later in the 2014 response.

% E: I moved r and nu to later, under statistical inference.  It made it seem like there were too many parameters here.
% I also removed italics around the model names because we don't actually use those names later on (more just the state codes).

To address diversification due to ploidy differences while also parsing out heterogeneity of diversification rates due another factor, we used models that include a hidden state \citep[HiSSE,][]{beaulieu_2016}. %B: inserted "(trait)", because that seems to be the goal - a biological explanation?  E: I would say hisse captures some factor that evolves like a binary trait, not necessarily a real biological trait
In these models, the observed diploid and polyploid states were each subdivided by a binary hidden trait with states $A$ and $B$.
In these $D/P+A/B$ ploidy and hidden state models, parameters include speciation rates ($\lambda_{D_A},\ \lambda_{D_B},\ \lambda_{P_A},\ \lambda_{P_B}$) and extinction rates ($\mu_{D_A},\ \mu_{D_B},\ \mu_{P_A},\ \mu_{P_B}$) for each subdivided state.
In the simplest case, the polyploidization rate, $\rho$, is the same within each hidden state, and the rates of transition between hidden states are symmetrical with parameter $\alpha$.
We also considered the more complex cases with different polyploidization rates in each hidden state ($\rho_A$ and $\rho_B$) and asymmetric transitions between hidden states ($\alpha$ and $\beta$).

% E: Rosana, please check this paragraph.  Did I get it correct?- R: Yes that is correct
To test if diversification rate heterogeneity is due only to a hidden trait and not the ploidy trait, we used character-independent diversification models \citep[CID,][]{beaulieu_2016}.
Parameters in this case are speciation and extinction rates for the hidden states ($\lambda_A,\ \lambda_B,\ \mu_A,\ \mu_B$), along with polyploidization ($\rho$) and transitions between hidden states ($(\alpha,\ \beta$).

Diagrams of these ploidy models are shown in \cref{figure:netdivall}AB.  % request from referee 2
% FIXME: ref to additional D/P models

\subsubsection{Breeding system and diversification}

To assess the effects of breeding system in the diversification process, we first fit a model with self-incompatible $(I)$ or self-compatible $(C)$ states.
This is the same as the analysis of \citet{goldberg_2010} but with an updated phylogeny \citep{sarkinen_2013}.
This $I/C$ breeding system model has parameters for state-specific speciation ($\lambda_I,\ \lambda_C$) and extinction ($\mu_I,\ \mu_C$), and for transitions from $I$ to $C$ ($q_{IC}$).

To parse out the effect of breeding system on diversification while allowing for the possibility of heterogeneous diversification rates unrelated to breeding system, we subdivided each of the breeding system states into hidden states $A$ and $B$.
This $I/C+A/B$ breeding system and hidden state model has parameters for state-specific speciation ($\lambda_{I_A},\ \lambda_{I_B},\ \lambda_{C_A},\ \lambda_{C_B}$) and extinction ($\mu_{I_A},\ \mu_{I_B},\ \mu_{C_A},\ \mu_{C_B}$), for loss of SI ($q_{IC}$), and for transitions between hidden states ($\alpha$).
We also considered more complex models with different transition rates in each hidden state and asymmetric transitions between hidden states ($\alpha$ and $\beta$). % FIXME
Similar models were used by \citet{freyman_2017} used to study diversification in Onagraceae.

% E: Rosana, please check this paragraph.  Did I get it correct?
We further used character-independent diversification models to test if diversification rate heterogeneity is due only to a hidden trait and not the breeding system trait.
Parameters in this case are speciation and extinction rates for the hidden states ($\lambda_A,\ \lambda_B,\ \mu_A,\ \mu_B$), along with loss of SI ($q_{IC}$) and transitions between hidden states ($\alpha$).

Self-incompatibility is homologous in all Solanaceae species in which S-alleles have been cloned and controlled crosses performed.
All species sampled to date possess a non-self recognition, RNase-based gametophytic self-incompatibility \citep[shared even with other euasterid families;][]{ramanauskas_2017}.
Furthermore, species that are distantly related within this family carry closely-related alleles, with deep trans-specific polymorphism at the locus that controls the SI response \citep{ioerger_1990, igic_2006}.
This represents very strong evidence that the $I$ state is ancestral in Solanaceae, and that the SI mechanism was not regained within this family.
Therefore, for all breeding system models, we estimated a transition rate from $I$ to $C$  but not the reverse ($q_{CI}=0$).
% This is an important assumption because ancestral state reconstruction in the models might differ when polyploidy and breeding system are analyzed as independent in the Solanaceae tree.
%
%B: What happens if SC->SI is not fixed? Asking for a friend.  E: Surprisingly, Rosana reports, results are not turned on their head. 
%B: Whew, I was worried. Er, "friend" says thanks. R- Your welcome, by mistake I did that model with reversibility from C to I. I didn't run it for as long as the rest but preliminary ancestral reconstructions seem almost identical when you add that parameter than when you don't.

\subsubsection{Ploidy, breeding system, and diversification}

Ploidy and breeding system might influence lineage diversification individually, but these two traits also have an intricate association as discussed in the Introduction.
Therefore, we considered a multi-state model that investigates the contribution of both traits and the allowable transitions between them.
This $ID/CD/CP$ ploidy and breeding system model has states for self-incompatible diploids $(ID)$, self-compatible diploids $(CD)$, and self-compatible polyploids $(CP)$; self-incompatible polyploids do not occur.
There are six parameters for state-specific diversification rates ($\lambda_{ID},\ \lambda_{CD},\ \lambda_{CP}$ for speciation; $\mu_{ID},\ \mu_{CD},\ \mu_{CP}$ for extinction) and three for transitions between states ($\rho_I,\ \rho_C$ for polyploidization transitions from $ID$ and $CD$ to $CP$, respectively; $q_{IC}$ for loss of self-incompatibility without polyploidization, from $ID$ to $CD$).
The total rate of loss of self-incompatibility, \ie transitions out of $ID$, is $q_{IC} + \rho_I$.
% E: Can we call it something other than q_IC?  It's a bit confusing to have the same parameter mean different things in different models.

% E: This paragraph is new.  Rosana, please check.
When including a new trait the question on whether 
the model with both breeding system and ploidy could provide a significantly better fit than the model with only ploidy was key.
Under all the statistical model comparison approaches, it is not valid to compare the $IC/CD/CP$ and $D/P$ model fits, as defined above, because they use different coding (i.e. (0,1) versus (0,1,2)). 
Similarly, the $IC/CD/CP$ and $I/C$ models cannot be compared statistically.
However, the evidence in the species and the tree are the same for both two-state and three-state models.
Instead, we define  and extend lumped models, as described first by \citet{tarasov_2019} for ontologies.  The lumped models proposed use the state space of the $IC/CD/CP$ model but constrain the rate parameters to mimic the behavior of the single-trait models. % should ref a figure

% E: We now have so many models to describe, I'm feeling like all this text may not be the best way.  I'm wondering if we can rely on figures/tables instead, and only write out the overall strategy. R- I feel the same but it might be very difficult to change at this point

Although the $ID/CD/CP$ model allows for two traits to potentially influence diversification, other unknown factors could as well.
We therefore added a hidden trait layer on top of our three-state model \citep[analogous to][]{caetano_2018, huang_2018}.
We fitted then $ID/CD/CP+A/B$ models, one with equal hidden rate $\alpha$ and equal transition rates between observed states to be independent of the hidden state (rates $\rho_I,\rho_C,\ q_{IC}$ as defined for the $ID/CD/CP$ model); second model were the hidden states are asymmetrical, and a third model were all parameters were different. For each of these models, there are additionally twelve diversification rate parameters ($\lambda_{ID_A},  \lambda_{ID_B},  \lambda_{CD_A}, \lambda_{CD_B}, \lambda_{CP_A}, \lambda_{CP_B}, \mu_{ID_A}, \mu_{ID_B}, \mu_{CD_A}, \mu_{CD_B},  \mu_{CP_A}, \mu_{CP_B}$).

\subsubsection{Pathways to polyploidy}

Considering ploidy and breeding system together, there are two evolutionary pathways from SI diploid to SC polyploid \citep{brunet2001, robertson_2011}.
In the one-step pathway, the CP state is produced directly from the ID state when whole genome duplication disables SI.
In the two-step pathway, the CD state is an intermediate: SI is first lost, and later the SC diploid undergoes polyploidization.
We quantify the relative contribution of these pathways to polyploidy in two ways, each using the maximum \textit{a posteriori} (MAP) estimates of rates from the $IC/CD/CP$ model.

Both of our methods are based on a propagation matrix that describes flow from $ID$ to $CP$, as in \citet{robertson_2011}.
We insert an artificial division in the $CP$ state, so that one substate contains the $CP$ species that arrived via the one-step pathway and the other substate contains the $CP$ species that arrived via the two-step pathway.
We consider only unidirectional change along each step of the pathway in order to separate them into clear alternatives, and because in this family there is no support for regain of SI, and no strong support for diploidization (see below).

First, we consider only the rates of transitions between these states, placing them in the propagation matrix \myvec{Q}.
The matrix $\myvec{P} = \exp(\myvec{Q} t)$ then provides the probabilities of changing from one state to any other state after time $t$.
Closed-form solutions for the two pathway probabilities are provided in \citet{robertson_2011}.
Our results will differ from those of \citet{robertson_2011} because our transition rate estimates come from a dated phylogeny and a model that allows for state-dependent diversification.

Second, we consider not only transitions between states but also diversification within each state.
State-dependent diversification can change the relative contributions of the two pathways.
For example, if the net diversification rate is small for $CD$, the two-step pathway will contribute relatively less.
We therefore include the difference between speciation and extinction along the diagonal elements of the propagation matrix.
As before, matrix exponentiation provides the relative chance of changing from one state to any other state after time $t$.
In this case, however, these are not probabilities because diversification changes the number of lineages as time passes.
We can still use their ratios to consider the relative contribution of each pathway, though, analogous to the normalized age structure in a growing population. % R- here a reference would be nice  E: Does Jake have a favorite ref? Otherwise, I guess a basic ecology textbook.

% E & R todo ?: for the case with net div, write out the propagation matrix and equations for pathway contributions

\subsubsection{Diploidization as an exploratory hypothesis}

The models described above allow polyploidization but not its reverse.
We explored the effects of allowing diploidization by adding a parameter $\delta$ for transitions from $P$ back to $D$ (in the $D/P$ and $D/P+A/B$ models) or from $CP$ back to $CD$ (in the $I/C$ and $I/C+A/B$ models); we did not allow transitions from $CP$ back to $ID$ because that would include regain of SI.
Previous modeling approaches \citep{mayrose_2011} have argued against inferring diploidization rates when using ploidy data that comes from classifications based on chromosome number multiplicity or chromosome number change models like chromEvol \citep{mayrose_2010, glick2014, mayrose_2015, freyman_2017}, which assume only aneuploid change and polyploidization.
Our ploidy classifications, however, when possible also incorporated information on chromosome multiplicity at the genus level and author conclusions within original studies with alternative sources of information (\eg geographic distribution, genus ploidy distribution).
Since it is not known whether diploidization can be detected under these additional ploidy classifications, we fit models with and without diploidization in order to test whether the conclusions about diversification are sensitive to including diploidization.
% As discussed by \citet{servedio_2014}, the presence or absence of a process can have an exploratory goal.
In our models, the diploidization parameter (or its absence, $\delta=0$), represents an opportunity to explore a possibly significant assumption that may not decisively affect interactions among ploidy, breeding system, and diversification.

\subsection{Statistical inference}

\subsubsection{Model fitting}

Parameters for each of the ten models were estimated using RevBayes \citep{hoehna_2016}.
Code for analyses and key results are available as Supplementary Information. % FIXME more permanent than \url{https://github.com/roszenil/solploidy}.
We accounted for incomplete sampling in all analyses by setting the probability of sampling a species at the present to $651/3000$ \citep[using the method of][]{fitzjohn_2009} since the Solanaceae family has approximately 3,000 species \citep{solsource}.
For all models, we assumed that speciation and extinction parameters had log-normal prior distributions with means equal to the expected net diversification rate $(\text{number of taxa} / [2 \times \text{root age}])$ and standard deviation $0.5$.
Priors for parameters defining trait changes were assumed to be gamma distributed with parameters $k=0.5$ and $\theta=1$. 
For each model, a Markov chain Monte Carlo \citep[MCMC;][]{metropolis1953equation,Hastings1970} was run in the high-performance computational cluster at the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute, which allowed for 5,000 generations of burn-in and a minimum of 200,000 generations of MCMC for each of the  models. % FIXME see referee comment about reporting convergence, not runtime
Convergence and mixing of each MCMC chain was determined by ensuring the effective sample size of each parameter was over 200.

We report posterior distributions for the model parameters, and also for the compound parameters of net diversification ($\lambda - \mu$) and extinction fraction ($\mu / \lambda$) for each state.
Additionally, ancestral states at each node in the phylogeny were sampled jointly during the MCMC analyses.
Ancestral state reconstructions for all models show the maximum \emph{a posteriori} estimates of the marginal probability distributions for each of the 594 internal nodes for each of the 10 models (\cref{suppfigure:DPnodipasr,suppfigure:DPasr,suppfigure:DPnodipABasr,suppfigure:DPABasr,suppfigure:ICasr,suppfigure:ICABasr,suppfigure:IDCDCPnodipasr,suppfigure:IDCDCPasr,suppfigure:IDCDCPnodipABasr,suppfigure:IDCDCPABasr}). % FIXME: I'm confused about if these are joint or marginal?  A bit more explanation would help.

\subsubsection{Model selection}

We calculated the marginal likelihood for each of the models using fifty stepping stone steps under the methodology of \citet{xie_2010}, implemented in RevBayes \citep{hoehna_2016}.
Each stepping stone step was found by calculating at least 500 generations of burn-in followed by a total of 1,000 MCMC steps (\cref{table:marginallike}).

Using the marginal likelihood values, we calculated Bayes factors to argue five key biological and methodological questions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Are hidden state necessary to add in this context?- Comparison of simple models against hidden state models
\item Is a second trait adding information to the diversification process?- Comparison of lumped models against IC/CD/CP models
\item Are diversification patterns only determined by hidden states and not the traits of interest?- Comparison of character independent models against hidden state 
\item Is there evidence for diploidization?- Comparison amongst models with and without diploidization
\item Do asymmetrical rates in the model affect the pattern of diversification? - Comparison amongst hidden states models with equal hidden rates and asymmetrical rates.
\end{enumerate}

Each model comparison is reported with a Bayes factor on the natural log scale: the comparison between models $M_0$ and $M_1$ is $BF(M_1,\ M_0) = \ln[ P(\mathbf{X} | M_1) - P(\mathbf{X} | M_0)]$.
There is `strong evidence'  for $M_1$ when this value is more than 2, `very strong' support when it is more than 6, and `extreme' support when it is more than 10 \citep{kass1995}.
