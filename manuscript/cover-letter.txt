Dear Colleagues, 

Please consider the enclosed manuscript for inclusion in the special issue on Plant Reproductive Systems. 

We make the most of the latest from the BiSSE family of methods, by conducting analyses of naively separate and joint effects of both 
ploidy and breeding systems in Solanaceae. We find that the latter mostly trump the former, with a few interesting complications. The findings broadly endorse the 
claim put forth in Barrett et al. (1996): â€œAmong life history traits, reproductive characters that determine mating system patterns are perhaps the most influential 
in governing macroevolution."
