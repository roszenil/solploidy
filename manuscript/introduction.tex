\section{Introduction}

Species accumulate around the tree of life at different rates.
The search for traits that explain these differences has been accelerated by dramatic increases in phylogenetic data and, despite some setbacks \citep{maddison_2015, rabosky_2015}, advances in analytical methods \citep{maddison_2007, fitzjohn_2009, goldberg_2012, beaulieu_2016}. % todo more refs: papers with big trees; quasse, bisse-ness, fisse, abc-quasse, maybe hoehna-vs-rabosky
In these studies, it is common to identify a single focal trait and investigate its association with rates of speciation and extinction. % (but see... ?) % refs: there must be some papers that musse on multiple traits? especially for geographic range?
This is problematic for two reasons.
On the biology side, the context in which traits occur can lead to complex interactions, perhaps with other traits that make up an organism or its environment.
On the methods side, excluding other traits that additionally influence diversification can lead to incorrect conclusions about the focal trait \citep{rabosky_2015, beaulieu_2016}.
One approach to this problem is to allow for a `hidden' or unspecified trait in the analysis \citep{beaulieu_2016}. % and an earlier beaulieu? applications of hisse?
This can be effective, but it leaves behind the question of whether the hidden trait corresponds to a real trait that should be sought, or whether it is an approximation of some unknowable heterogeneity, as well as whether interactions between the known and hidden trait were modeled appropriately.
Alternatively, we can simultaneously consider the effects of more than one known trait, especially in systems where multiple traits are suspected to influence diversification, and where interactions between those traits are well understood.
% B: We can then have a good prior, reliable data, and replicate the studies.  E: Agree. But when I tried to add it, I realized hidden models can also be hypothesis-generating, with the purported hidden trait identified in the next clade.
In this paper, we focus on two of the best studied traits in flowering plants, ploidy and breeding system, and investigate their individual and joint effects on diversification.

Polyploidization multiplies the genomic content of cells, and it consequently has the potential to affect many or all traits and a great variety of evolutionary processes.
It is also a mutation that occurs commonly in plants, at it is widespread at both population and lineage scales.
The prevalence of variation in chromosome number, and especially ploidy, has been broadly considered a salient feature of flowering plants for nearly a century \citep{stebbins1938}. % B: instead of "ploidy" here, we may wish to use some stand-in for karyotype multiples, and stick to that language throughout. E: What word would that be? I was taking "ploidy" to mean "whatever multiple," but is that a terminological abuse?
The recent dramatic increase in the scale of available genome sequences uncovered ancient rounds of whole-genome duplications, and subsequent diploidization, across angiosperms \citep{lynch2000, vision2000}. % E: I am deferring to R's use of "diploidization" instead of "re-diploidization"
Nearly all lineages of flowering plants are thought to have undergone at least one or two rounds of polyploidization. % todo refs, jiao etc
%
The prevalence of polyploidy, its variation across clades, and its large effects on genotypes and phenotypes raises the hypothesis that ploidy plays an important role in shaping rates of speciation and extinction.
This has led to a debate: \citet{mayrose_2011, mayrose_2015} found a lower rate of lineage diversification for polyploids, while \citet{soltis_2014} argued that polyploidy is not an evolutionary dead end because whole genome duplications occurred at the base of many successful angiosperm clades, and \citet{landis_2018} reported higher diversification rates following some whole genome duplications. % and tank2015?
Our study revisits this question, additionally incorporating the process of diploidization.
% E:  Rosana, could you add a little about the importance of including diploidization?  todo
Furthermore, we consider the interaction between polyploidy and other traits.

From the very beginning of polyploidy research, the study of this cytogenetic property considered correlations with other traits \citep{stebbins1938}. 
Some of these associations are driven by indirect or ecological effects, such as the tendency for polyploidy, and other traits, to be found at higher latitudes or marginal habitats. % todo refs: husband etc
Other correlations may have a more direct, causal connection.
Among the many changes associated with polyploidization, perhaps the most prominent is the association between polyploidy and propensity for self-fertilization \citep{stebbins1950, barrett1988}.
In some cases, the evidence for a correlated shift in mating system along with polyploidization appears limited and sometimes contradictory \citep{barringer2007, barrett2008, husband2008}.
% barrett2008: "Because polyploidy affects the entire genome, it is perhaps not surprising that it influences many aspects of the phenotype, including the mating system. However, although it has long been recognized that the evolutionary transition from diploidy to polyploidy may result in correlated changes in mating patterns, the theoretical and empirical evidence is limited and often contradictory." (p.5)
In other cases, however, polyploidy is not only a suspected correlate of breeding systems but indeed a causal link \citep{stout1942, lewis1947}.
Doubled number of alleles in pollen is thought to effect disruption of the genetic mechanisms in gametophytic self-incompatibility systems, which prevent self-fertilization \citep{entani1999, tsukamoto2005, kubo2010}. 
This creates a correlation between polyploidy and self-compatibility by preventing the existence of self-incompatible polyploids.
In clades with these systems, it is thus natural to consider the simultanous macroevolution of ploidy and breeding system.

% E note to self: edit this next...
Breeding system shifts---changes in the collection of physiological and morphological traits that determine the likelihood that any two gametes unite---are remarkably common and affect the distribution and amount of genetic variation in populations \citep{stebbins1974, barrett2013}.
In particular, self-incompatibility (SI) systems cause a plant to reject its own pollen, and their loss, yielding self-compatibility (SC), is one of the most replicated transitions in flowering plant evolution. % refs: stebbins, igic
Previous phylogenetic analyses have reported higher rates of diversification for SI than for SC lineages \citep{goldberg_2010, devos2014}, but they have not considered the possibility of other correlated traits driving this pattern.
Given that changes in ploidy and breeding systems may be causally related and have profound affects on the fate of lineages, it seems particularly profitable to examine possible interactions in their macroevolutionary effects.
This includes their joint influence on lineage diversification, and also potential patterns in the order of their transitions.
For example, do losses of SI more commonly occur tied to polyploidization, or without a ploidy shift?
Do polyploids arise more commonly from SI or SC diploids?
\Citet{robertson_2011} found that the pathway from SI diploids to SC polyploids is dominated by loss of SI followed later by polyploidization over long timescales, but proceeds in one step via polyploidization of SI species over short timescales.
We revisit this question with a greatly improved phylogeny and methods that allow for diversification rate differences. % E: Technically, we allow for div effects in the rate estimates, but not in the pathways.  If SC-D have so much extinction that the step to SC-P never happens, the old pathway methods won't see that.  I'll think about if this is easy to fix.
% And, are diversification rates of polyploid SC lineages different if one or other path was taken? \citet{charlesworth1985} % E: This is a great question.  We don't answer it with this round of analyses.  Maybe when we have more time for the revision?
