%B: I placed this out of order, so you can see it
The prevalence and significance of polyploidy was broadly considered a salient feature of flowering plants \citep{}, even before the advent of genomic tools dramatically escalated the stakes, so that nearly flowering plants are thought to have undergone at least one round of polyploidization \citep{}.
It is therefore perhaps surprising that there appears to be little agreement regarding the evolutionary consequences of polyploidy, especially how it affects diversification rates. %species richness.

Polyploidization changes the genomic content of all cells, and consequently has the potential to affect a wide variety, if not all, traits. 
Among the many of changes associated with polyploidization, perhaps the most prominent is the association between polyploidy and propensity for self-fertilization \citep{stebbins1950, barrett1988}.
Polyploidy is not only a suspected correlate of breeding systems but a causal link \citep{stout1942, lewis1947}.
Doubled number of alleles in pollen is strongly suspected to effect disruption of the genetic mechanisms in gametophytic self-incompatibility systems \citep{entani1999, tsukamoto2005, kubo2010}. 
Polyploidy is also thought to be associated with changes in the rate of self-fertilization, although the evidence for this correlated shift in mating system appears limited and sometimes contradictory \citep{barringer2007, barrett2008, husband2008}.
% It's not Spencer's best line, but it's not bad for our work: Barrett 2008: "Because polyploidy affects the entire genome, it is perhaps not surprising that it influences many aspects of the phenotype, including the mating system. However, although it has long been recognized that the evolutionary transition from diploidy to polyploidy may result in correlated changes in mating patterns, the theoretical and empirical evidence is limited and often contradictory."
% how that generates associations (and variable associations of mating system and ploidy! husband2008, others cited by barrett2013
Breeding system shifts---changes in the collection of physiological and morphological traits that determine the likelihood that any two gametes unite---are remarkably common and affect the distribution and amount of genetic variation in populations \citep{stebbins1974,barrett2013}.
They are by themselves thought to have a broad effect on other traits. 
The frequent transition from self-incompatibility (SI) to self-compatibility (SC) is strongly associated with net diversification rate changes \citep{goldberg_2010,devos2014}.
Given that  changes in ploidy and breeding systems may be causally related and have profound profound affects on the fate of lineages, it seems particularly profitable to examine whether and how their macroevolutionary effects interact.

Studying diversification linked to trait evolution\newline
% Here I need help (perhaps will be the last line I write)
%In these context, botanist have been asking how polyploidy shapes patterns of diversification. 
The prevalence of polyploidy and its detection across multiple and highly diverse clades of angiosperms inevitably lead to the hypothesis of the importance of polyploidy in the speciation and extinction patterns observed across the flowering plant phylogeny. 
At the same time, a similar question has been asked in the breeding system world, where self-compatibility has evolved multiple times in flowering plants. 
However, the influence in diversification using both polyploidy and self-compatibility information has not been studied simultaneously.

- Why polyploidy and self-compatibility in particular makes for an  interesting study in the context of diversification\newline
In the polyploidy world, an important debate regarding the diversification of angiosperms has been ongoing since the publication of \citet{mayrose_2011}. The authors discovered that using the latest diversification model linked to two states diploid and polyploid, the net diversification of polyploids was much slower than the net diversification rate than polyploids. This result was surprising and an sparked a discussion about the long-term evolutionary consequences of polyploidy. \citet{soltis_2014} questioned if polyploidy should be regarded as an evolutionary dead-end since the net diversification of polyploids was negative, despite overwhelming evidence about the incidence of polyploidy  especially at the root of highly diverse angiosperm claims (ref here). A year later, diversification models were re-tested and corrected, and still found the same pattern \citep{mayrose_2015}, to the disappointment of plenty of botanists there was no denying of the weak trend of diversification that polyploids left behind. The most recent study by \citet{landis_2018} that used not only the presence of polyploidy in the tips but also the number of whole genome duplications in a taxon lineage found that.... \newline  Meanwhile, studies focusing on diversification patterns and  breeding system have consistently found that self-incompatible plants often have higher net diversification rates compare to their self-compatible counterparts (Emma and Boris' papers here, what about papers that are not solanaceae?) 

- Why other traits need to be considered as well\newline


- What other models and studies have done in the past\newline

- What is lacking from past approaches? \newline
There are two key questions that at the time of the polyploidy debate were difficult to ask. The first is if the models used to measure the diversification of polyploids were correct, and the second question is if the models have potentially included more evidence and potential traits that are not polyploidy or other lines of evidence that could be driving the patterns. At the time, in a different context \citet{beaulieu_2016} were finding an alternative solution to the first question, coming up with a new model that could represent the broad heterogeneity of the diversification process and parse out the signal between the trait of interest and the noise in diversification. Their model, the hidden state speciation and extinction model is a key component to detect whether polyploidy our something else unknown but related to it is driving the speciation and extinction patterns that we see in angiosperms. \newline
What is our proposal to tackle this problem?\newline

The second question (talk here about breeding system and polyploidy, and how this could be different across clades and this is one of the reasons why we focused on Solanaceae).
