%Studying diversification linked to trait evolution\newline
%Here I need help (perhaps will be the last line I write). In these context, botanist have been asking how polyploidy shapes patterns of diversification. The prevalence of polyploidy and its detection across multiple and highly diverse clades of angiosperms inevitably lead to the hypothesis of the importance of polyploidy in the speciation and extinction patterns observed across the flowering plant phylogeny.  At the same time, a similar question has been asked in the breeding system world, where self-compatibility has evolved multiple times in flowering plants. However, the influence in diversification using both polyploidy and self-compatibility information has not been studied simultaneously.

%Why polyploidy and self-compatibility in particular makes for an  interesting study in the context of diversification\newline In the polyploidy world, an important debate regarding the diversification of angiosperms has been ongoing since the publication of \citet{mayrose_2011}. The authors discovered that using the latest diversification model linked to two states diploid and polyploid, the net diversification of polyploids was much slower than the net diversification rate than polyploids. This result was surprising and an sparked a discussion about the long-term evolutionary consequences of polyploidy. \citet{soltis_2014} questioned if polyploidy should be regarded as an evolutionary dead-end since the net diversification of polyploids was negative, despite overwhelming evidence about the incidence of polyploidy  especially at the root of highly diverse angiosperm claims (ref here). A year later, diversification models were re-tested and corrected, and still found the same pattern \citep{mayrose_2015}, to the disappointment of plenty of botanists there was no denying of the weak trend of diversification that polyploids left behind. The most recent study by \citet{landis_2018} that used not only the presence of polyploidy in the tips but also the number of whole genome duplications in a taxon lineage found that.... \newline  Meanwhile, studies focusing on diversification patterns and  breeding system have consistently found that self-incompatible plants often have higher net diversification rates compare to their self-compatible counterparts (Emma and Boris' papers here, what about papers that are not solanaceae?) 

%- Why other traits need to be considered as well\newline
%- What other models and studies have done in the past\newline
%- What is lacking from past approaches? \newline
%There are two key questions that at the time of the polyploidy debate were difficult to ask. The first is if the models used to measure the diversification of polyploids were correct, and the second question is if the models have potentially included more evidence and potential traits that are not polyploidy or other lines of evidence that could be driving the patterns. At the time, in a different context \citet{beaulieu_2016} were finding an alternative solution to the first question, coming up with a new model that could represent the broad heterogeneity of the diversification process and parse out the signal between the trait of interest and the noise in diversification. Their model, the hidden state speciation and extinction model is a key component to detect whether polyploidy our something else unknown but related to it is driving the speciation and extinction patterns that we see in angiosperms. \newline

%B: this is highly preliminary, for your editing consideration.
The systematic search for traits which influence the rates at which species accumulate around the tree of life is at the productive confluence of drastic increases in the size of datasets and equally dramatic improvements in analytical methods \citep{maddison_2007,fitzjohn_2009,goldberg_2012,beaulieu_2016}. % some papers with big trees.
Many limitations impede our progress in identifying estimating trait-dependent differences in speciation and extinction rates \citep{maddison_2014, rabosky_2015}. % add Moore/Hoehna?
Nevertheless, the field has made steady advances in relaxing assumptions and addressing conceptual difficulties. %maybe add beaulieu_2016 here, instead
One limitation is the pervasive consideration of traits in isolation. 
For example, studies commonly aim to identify the effects of alternate states of a single trait on the diversification process. 
This is problematic, because the context in which traits occur can lead to complex interactions, perhaps with other traits that make up an organism or its environment.
Consequently, an obvious direction for improvement of trait-dependent diversification models ought to involve development of approaches that allow investigation of individual and joint effects of traits on diversification, as well as each other's state transitions.
Ideally, the initial application of such approaches ought to rely on well-sampled and studied traits, whose interactions are relatively clear, and which show a wide phylogenetic distribution. 
%B: We can then have a good prior, reliable data, and replicate the studies.
In this paper, we use two of the best studied traits in flowering plants, ploidy and breeding system, and demonstrate an approach to consider their individual and joint effects on diversification.

The prevalence of variation in chromosome number, and especially ploidy, has been broadly considered a salient feature of flowering plants for nearly a century. %\citep{stebbins1938}; instead of "ploidy" here, we may wish to use some stand-in for karyotype multiples, and stick to that language throughout.
The recent dramatic increase in the scale of available genome sequences uncovered ancient rounds of whole-genome duplications, and subsequent re-diploidization, across angiosperms \citep{lynch2000,vision2000}. 
Nearly all lineages of flowering plants are thought to have undergone at least one or two rounds of polyploidization. %cite
It is therefore surprising that there is little agreement regarding the evolutionary consequences of polyploidy, especially how it affects diversification rates. %species richness; cite: mayrose2011, soltis2014, mayrose2015, tank2015, landis2018?

Polyploidization alters the genomic content of all cells, and consequently has the potential to affect a wide variety, if not all, traits. 
From the very beginning, the study of this cytogenetic property considered correlations with other traits \citep{stebbins1938}. 
Among the many of changes associated with polyploidization, perhaps the most prominent is the association between polyploidy and propensity for self-fertilization \citep{stebbins1950, barrett1988}.
Polyploidy is not only a suspected correlate of breeding systems but a causal link \citep{stout1942, lewis1947}.
Doubled number of alleles in pollen is strongly suspected to effect disruption of the genetic mechanisms in gametophytic self-incompatibility systems \citep{entani1999, tsukamoto2005, kubo2010}. 
Polyploidy is also thought to be associated with changes in the rate of self-fertilization, although the evidence for this correlated shift in mating system appears limited and sometimes contradictory \citep{barringer2007, barrett2008, husband2008}.

Breeding system shifts---changes in the collection of physiological and morphological traits that determine the likelihood that any two gametes unite---are remarkably common and affect the distribution and amount of genetic variation in populations \citep{stebbins1974,barrett2013}.
They are by themselves thought to have a broad effect on other traits. 
The frequent transition from self-incompatibility (SI) to self-compatibility (SC) is strongly associated with net diversification rate changes \citep{goldberg_2010,devos2014}.
Given that changes in ploidy and breeding systems may be causally related and have  profound affects on the fate of lineages, it seems particularly profitable to examine whether and how their macroevolutionary effects interact.
Moreover,  increases in ploidy are known to directly affect breeding system states and present a rare opportunity for the study of paths and path-dependence on trait evolution and diversification.
For example, we could ask if the ordinary mutation (and fixation) causes more losses of SI than polyploidization, whether more SC polyploids are generated directly, after polyploidization of diploid SI lineages, or through a two-step pathway, involving loss of SC and subsequent polyploidization of a SC lineage.
And, are diversification rates of polyploid SC lineages different if one or other path was taken? \citet{charlesworth1985}
