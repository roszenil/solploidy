\section{Discussion}

% diversification
%     main finding about our traits
%     more generally, not okay to approximate musse with bisse when states are correlated (cf Pyron)

% diploidization: comment
%     effect on inferred diversification

% pathways: compare/contrast with robertson2011
%     \rho_I > \rho_C in all!

% alpha is always low
%     new supp fig showing how A & B are inferred on the tree?  at least for ID/CD/CP+A/B model
%     maybe we can hypothesize factors that underlie the hidden state (geography?)

% issues
%     meaning of diploidization parameter
%     irreversibility SI -> SC assumption
