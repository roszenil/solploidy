	Abstract = {A compound hypothesis positing that self-fertilization is an evolutionary dead end conflates two distinct claims: the transition from outcrossing to selfing is unidirectional; and the diversification rate, or the balance of the speciation and extinction rate, is negative for selfing species. Both claims have enjoyed widespread informal support for decades, but have recently come under suspicion. Sources of data that apparently contradict strongly asymmetric mating system transitions often rely on statistical phylogenetic tests plagued by profound flaws. Although recently developed models mend preceding approaches, they have been employed sparingly, and many problems remain. Theoretical investigations, genetic data and applications of new phylogenetic methods provide indirect support for an association of selfing with negative diversification rates. We lack direct tests of reversals from selfing to outcrossing, and require data concerning the genetic basis and complexity of independently evolved outcrossing adaptations. The identification of the mechanisms that limit the longevity of selfing lineages has been difficult. Limitations may include brief and variable durations of selfing lineages, as well as ongoing difficulties in relating additive genetic and nucleotide variation. Furthermore, a common line of evidence for the stability of mixed mating - based simply on its frequent occurrence - is misleading. We make specific suggestions for research programs that aim to provide a richer understanding of mating system evolution and seriously challenge Stebbins' venerable hypothesis. \copyright 2013 The Authors.

	Abstract = {Sequences of 11 alleles of the gametophytic self-incompatibility locus (S locus) from three species of the Solanaceae family have recently been determined. Pairwise comparisons of these alleles reveal two unexpected observations: (i) amino acid sequence similarity can be as low as 40\% within species and (ii) some interspecific similarities are higher than intraspecific similarities. The gene genealogy clearly illustrates this unusual pattern of relationships. The data suggest that some of the polymorphism at the S locus existed prior to the divergence of these species and has been maintained to the present. In support of this hypothesis, the number of shared polymorphic sites was found to exceed the number found in simulations with independent accumulation of mutations. Strictly neutral evolution is exceedingly unlikely to maintain the polymorphism for such a long time. The allele multiplicity and extreme age of the alleles is consistent with Wright's classic one-locus population genetic model of gametophytic self-incompatibility. Similarities between the plant S locus and the mammalian major histocompatibility complex are discussed.},

	Abstract = {The evolutionary relationship between self-incompatibility systems in different families of flowering plants has long been a topic of interest. Physiological differences in the mode of gene action and the enormous sequence differences between genes with different modes of action suggest that many instances of self-incompatibility have arisen independently. In contrast, previous analyses of the S-RNase associated with gametophytic self-incompatibility in the eudicot families (Solanaceae, Scrophulariaceae, and Rosaceae) have suggested that sequences within families form well-supported and distinct lineages.  In this study we demonstrate that in fact, S-RNase-mediated gametophytic self-incompatibility evolved only once in the eudicots.},

	Abstract = {T2-type RNases are responsible for self-pollen recognition and rejection in three distantly related families of flowering plants-the Solanaceae, Scrophulariaceae, and Rosaceae. We used phylogenetic analyses of 67 T2-type RNases together with information on intron number and position to determine whether the use of RNases for self-incompatibility in these families is homologous or convergent. All methods of phylogenetic reconstruction as well as patterns of variation in intron structure find that all self-incompatibility RNases along with non-S genes from only two taxa form a monophyletic clade. Several lines of evidence suggest that the best interpretation of this pattern is homology of self-incompatibility RNases from the Scrophulariaceae, Solanaceae, and Rosaceae. Because the most recent common ancestor of these three families is the ancestor of approximately 75\% of dicot families, our results indicate that RNase-based self-incompatibility was the ancestral state in the majority of dicots.},

	Abstract = {Breakdown of self-incompatibility occurs repeatedly in flowering plants with important evolutionary consequences. In plant families in which self-incompatibility is mediated by S-{RNases}, previous evidence suggests that polyploidy may often directly cause self-compatibility through the formation of diploid pollen grains. We use three approaches to examine relationships between self-incompatibility and ploidy. First, we test whether evolution of self-compatibility and polyploidy is correlated in the nightshade family (Solanaceae), and find the expected close association between polyploidy and self-compatibility. Second, we compare the rate of breakdown of self-incompatibility in the absence of polyploidy against the rate of breakdown that arises as a byproduct of polyploidization, and we find the former to be greater. Third, we apply a novel extension to these methods to show that the relative magnitudes of the macroevolutionary pathways leading to self-compatible polyploids are time dependent. Over small time intervals, the direct pathway from self-incompatible diploids is dominant, whereas the pathway through self-compatible diploids prevails over longer time scales. This pathway analysis is broadly applicable to models of character evolution in which sequential combinations of rates are compared. Finally, given the strong evidence for both irreversibility of the loss of self-incompatibility in the family and the significant association between self-compatibility and polyploidy, we argue that ancient polyploidy is highly unlikely to have occurred within the Solanaceae, contrary to previous claims based on genomic analyses. \copyright 2010 The Author(s).

	Abstract = {Polyploidy, the doubling of genomic content, is a widespread feature, especially among plants, yet its macroevolutionary impacts are contentious. Traditionally, polyploidy has been considered an evolutionary dead end, whereas recent genomic studies suggest that polyploidy has been a key driver of macroevolutionary success. We examined the consequences of polyploidy on the time scale of genera across a diverse set of vascular plants, encompassing hundreds of inferred polyploidization events. Likelihood-based analyses indicate that polyploids generally exhibit lower speciation rates and higher extinction rates than diploids, providing the first quantitative corroboration of the dead-end hypothesis. The increased speciation rates of diploids can, in part, be ascribed to their capacity to speciate via polyploidy. Only particularly fit lineages of polyploids may persist to enjoy longer-term evolutionary success.},

@article{wood_2009,
	Abstract = {Since its discovery in 1907, polyploidy has been recognized as an important phenomenon in vascular plants, and several lines of evidence indicate that most, if not all, plant species ultimately have a polyploid ancestry. However, previous estimates of the frequency of polyploid speciation suggest that the formation and establishment of neopolyploid species is rare. By combining information from the botanical community's vast cytogenetic and phylogenetic databases, we establish that 15\% of angiosperm and 31\% of fern speciation events are accompanied by ploidy increase. These frequency estimates are higher by a factor of four than earlier estimates and lead to a standing incidence of polyploid species within genera of 35\% (n = 1,506). Despite this high incidence, we find no direct evidence that polyploid lines, once established, enjoy greater net species diversification. Thus, the widespread occurrence of polyploid taxa appears to result from the substantial contribution of polyploidy to cladogenesis, but not from subsequent increases in diversification rates of polyploid lines.},

	Abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The Solanaceae is a plant family of great economic importance. Despite a wealth of phylogenetic work on individual clades and a deep knowledge of particular cultivated species such as tomato and potato, a robust evolutionary framework with a dated molecular phylogeny for the family is still lacking. Here we investigate molecular divergence times for Solanaceae using a densely-sampled species-level phylogeny. We also review the fossil record of the family to derive robust calibration points, and estimate a chronogram using an uncorrelated relaxed molecular clock. {RESULTS}: Our densely-sampled phylogeny shows strong support for all previously identified clades of Solanaceae and strongly supported relationships between the major clades, particularly within Solanum. The Tomato clade is shown to be sister to section Petota, and the Regmandra clade is the first branching member of the Potato clade. The minimum age estimates for major splits within the family provided here correspond well with results from previous studies, indicating splits between tomato and potato around 8 Million years ago (Ma) with a 95\% highest posterior density ({HPD}) 7-10 Ma, Solanum and Capsicum c. 19 Ma (95\% {HPD} 17-21), and Solanum and Nicotiana c. 24 Ma (95\% {HPD} 23-26). {CONCLUSIONS}: Our large time-calibrated phylogeny provides a significant step towards completing a fully sampled species-level phylogeny for Solanaceae, and provides age estimates for the whole family. The chronogram now includes 40\% of known species and all but two monotypic genera, and is one of the best sampled angiosperm family phylogenies both in terms of taxon sampling and resolution published thus far. The increased resolution in the chronogram combined with the large increase in species sampling will provide much needed data for the examination of many biological questions using Solanaceae as a model system.},

@article{zhan_2016,
	Abstract = {{PREMISE} {OF} {THE} {STUDY}: Polyploidization is a common and recurring phenomenon in plants and is often thought to be a mechanism of "instant speciation". Whether polyploidization is associated with the formation of new species (cladogenesis) or simply occurs over time within a lineage (anagenesis), however, has never been assessed systematically. {METHODS}: We tested this hypothesis using phylogenetic and karyotypic information from 235 plant genera (mostly angiosperms). We first constructed a large database of combined sequence and chromosome number data sets using an automated procedure. We then applied likelihood models ({Cla\SSE}) that estimate the degree of synchronization between polyploidization and speciation events in maximum likelihood and Bayesian frameworks. {KEY} {RESULTS}: Our maximum likelihood analysis indicated that 35 genera supported a model that includes cladogenetic transitions over a model with only anagenetic transitions, whereas three genera supported a model that incorporates anagenetic transitions over one with only cladogenetic transitions. Furthermore, the Bayesian analysis supported a preponderance of cladogenetic change in four genera but did not support a preponderance of anagenetic change in any genus. {CONCLUSIONS}: Overall, these phylogenetic analyses provide the first broad confirmation that polyploidization is temporally associated with speciation events, suggesting that it is indeed a major speciation mechanism in plants, at least in some genera. \copyright 2016 Botanical Society of America.},

@article{glick_2016,
	Abstract = {{PREMISE} {OF} {THE} {STUDY}: Flowering plants display a variety of sexual systems, ranging from complete cosexuality (hermaphroditism) to separate-sexed individuals (dioecy). While dioecy is relatively rare, it has evolved many times and is present in many plant families. Transitions in sexual systems are hypothesized to be affected by large genomic events such as whole-genome duplication, or polyploidy, and several models have been proposed to explain the observed patterns of association. {METHODS}: In this study, we assessed the association between ploidy and sexual system (separate or combined sexes). To this end, we assembled a database of ploidy levels and sexual systems for ?1000 species, spanning 18 genera and 15 families. We applied several phylogenetic comparative approaches, including Pagel's coevolutionary framework and sister clade analyses, for detecting correlations between ploidy level and sexual system. {KEY} {RESULTS}: Our results indicate a broad association between polyploidy and sexual system dimorphism, with low evolutionary stability of the diploid-dioecious condition observed in several clades. A detailed examination of the clades exhibiting this correlation reveals that it is underlain by various patterns of transition rate asymmetry. {CONCLUSIONS}: We conclude that the long-hypothesized connection between ploidy and sexual system holds in some clades, although it may well be affected by factors that differ from clade to clade. Our results further demonstrate that to better understand the evolutionary processes involved, more sophisticated methods and extensive and detailed data sets are required for both broad and focused inquiry. \copyright 2016 Botanical Society of America.},

	Abstract = {Many major clades of angiosperms have several whole genome duplications (polyploidization events) in their distant past, suggesting that polyploidy drives or at least permits diversification. However, data on recently diverged groups are more equivocal, finding little evidence of elevated diversification following polyploidy. The discrepancy may be attributable at least in part to methodology. Many studies use indirect methods, such as chromosome numbers, genome size, and Ks plots, to test polyploidy, although these approaches can be misleading, and often lack sufficient resolution. A direct test of diversification following polyploidy requires a sequence-based approach that traces the history of nuclear genomes rather than species. These methods identify the point of coalescence of ancestral genomes, but may be misleading about the time and thus the extent of diversification. Limitations of existing methods mean that the connection between polyploidy and diversification has not been rigorously tested and remains unknown. Copyright \copyright 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{freyman_2017,
	Abstract = {A major goal of evolutionary biology is to identify key evolutionary transitions that correspond with shifts in speciation and extinction rates. Stochastic character mapping has become the primary method used to infer the timing, nature, and number of character state transitions along the branches of a phylogeny. The method is widely employed for standard substitution models of character evolution. However, current approaches cannot be used for models that specifically test the association of character state transitions with shifts in diversification rates such as state-dependent speciation and extinction ({\SSE}) models. Here we introduce a new stochastic character mapping algorithm that overcomes these limitations, and apply it to study mating system evolution over a densely sampled fossil-calibrated phylogeny of the plant family Onagraceae. Utilizing a hidden state {\SSE} model we tested the association of the loss of self-incompatibility with shifts in diversification rates. Confirming long standing theory, we found that self-compatible lineages have higher extinction rates and lower net diversification rates compared to self-incompatible lineages. Further, our mapped character histories show that the loss of self-incompatibility is followed by a short-term spike in speciation rates, which declines after a time lag of several million years resulting in negative net diversification. Lineages that have long been self-compatible such as Fuchsia and Clarkia are in a previously unrecognized and ongoing evolutionary decline. Our results demonstrate that stochastic character mapping of {\SSE} models is a powerful tool for examining the timing and nature of both character state transitions and shifts in diversification rates over the phylogeny.},

	Abstract = {Species diversity is remarkably unevenly distributed among flowering plant lineages. Despite a growing toolbox of research methods, the reasons underlying this patchy pattern have continued to perplex plant biologists for the past two decades. In this review, we examine the present understanding of transitions in flowering plant evolution that have been proposed to influence speciation and extinction. In particular, ploidy changes, transitions between tropical and nontropical biomes, and shifts in floral form have received attention and have offered some surprises in terms of which factors influence speciation and extinction rates. Mating systems and dispersal characteristics once predominated as determining factors, yet recent evidence suggests that these changes are not as influential as previously thought or are important only when paired with range shifts. Although range extent is an important correlate of speciation, it also influences extinction and brings an applied focus to diversification research. Recent studies that find that past diversification can predict present-day extinction risk open an exciting avenue for future research to help guide conservation prioritization.},

@article{landis_2018,
	Abstract = {{PREMISE} {OF} {THE} {STUDY}: Polyploidy or whole-genome duplication ({WGD}) pervades the evolutionary history of angiosperms. Despite extensive progress in our understanding of {WGD}, the role of these events in promoting diversification is still not well understood. We seek to clarify the possible association between {WGD} and diversification rates in flowering plants. {METHODS}: Using a previously published phylogeny spanning all land plants (31,749 tips) and {WGD} events inferred from analyses of the 1000 Plants ({1KP}) transcriptome data, we analyzed the association of {WGDs} and diversification rates following numerous {WGD} events across the angiosperms. We used a stepwise {AIC} approach ({MEDUSA}), a Bayesian mixture model approach ({BAMM}), and state-dependent diversification analyses ({Mu\SSE}) to investigate patterns of diversification. Sister-clade comparisons were used to investigate species richness after {WGDs}. {KEY} {RESULTS}: Based on the density of {1KP} taxon sampling, 106 {WGDs} were unambiguously placed on the angiosperm phylogeny. We identified 334-530 shifts in diversification rates. We found that 61 {WGD} events were tightly linked to changes in diversification rates, and state-dependent diversification analyses indicated higher speciation rates for subsequent rounds of {WGD}. Additionally, 70 of 99 {WGD} events showed an increase in species richness compared to the sister clade. {CONCLUSIONS}: Forty-six of the 106 {WGDs} analyzed appear to be closely associated with upshifts in the rate of diversification in angiosperms. Shifts in diversification do not appear more likely than random within a four-node lag phase following a {WGD}; however, younger {WGD} events are more likely to be followed by an upshift in diversification than older {WGD} events. \copyright 2018 Botanical Society of America.},

@article{goldberg_2012,
	Abstract = {Classic questions about trait evolution-including the directionality of character change and its interactions with lineage diversification-intersect in the study of plant breeding systems. Transitions from self-incompatibility to self-compatibility are frequent, and they may proceed within a species ("anagenetic" mode of breeding system change) or in conjunction with speciation events ("cladogenetic" mode of change). We apply a recently developed phylogenetic model to the nightshade family Solanaceae, quantifying the relative contributions of these two modes of evolution along with the tempo of breeding system change, speciation, and extinction. We find that self-incompatibility, a genetic mechanism that prevents self-fertilization, is lost largely by the cladogenetic mode. Self-compatible species are thus more likely to arise from the isolation of a newly self-compatible population than from species-wide fixation of self-compatible mutants. Shared polymorphism at the locus that governs self-incompatibility shows it to be ancestral and not regained within this family. We demonstrate that failing to account for cladogenetic character change misleads phylogenetic tests of evolutionary irreversibility, both for breeding system in Solanaceae and on simulated trees. \copyright 2012 The Author(s).

@article{maddison_2007,
	Abstract = {Determining whether speciation and extinction rates depend on the state of a particular character has been of long-standing interest to evolutionary biologists. To assess the effect of a character on diversification rates using likelihood methods requires that we be able to calculate the probability that a group of extant species would have evolved as observed, given a particular model of the character's effect. Here we describe how to calculate this probability for a phylogenetic tree and a two-state (binary) character under a simple model of evolution (the "{Bi\SSE}" model, binary-state speciation and extinction). The model involves six parameters, specifying two speciation rates (rate when the lineage is in state 0; rate when in state 1), two extinction rates (when in state 0; when in state 1), and two rates of character state change (from 0 to 1, and from 1 to 0). Using these probability calculations, we can do maximum likelihood inference to estimate the model's parameters and perform hypothesis tests (e.g., is the rate of speciation elevated for one character state over the other?). We demonstrate the application of the method using simulated data with known parameter values.},

	Abstract = {Although numerous studies have surveyed the frequency with which different plant characters are associated with polyploidy, few statistical tools are available to identify the factors that potentially facilitate polyploidy. We describe a new probabilistic model, {BiChroM}, designed to associate the frequency of polyploidy and chromosomal change with a binary phenotypic character in a phylogeny. {BiChroM} provides a robust statistical framework for testing differences in rates of polyploidy associated with phenotypic characters along a phylogeny while simultaneously allowing for evolutionary transitions between character states. We used {BiChroM} to test whether polyploidy is more frequent in woody or herbaceous plants, based on tree with 4711 eudicot species. Although polyploidy occurs in woody species, rates of chromosome doubling were over six times higher in herbaceous species. Rates of single chromosome increases or decreases were also far higher in herbaceous than woody species. Simulation experiments indicate that {BiChroM} performs well with little to no bias and relatively little variance at a wide range of tree depths when trees have at least 500 taxa. Thus, {BiChroM} provides a first step toward a rigorous statistical framework for assessing the traits that facilitate polyploidy. \copyright 2017 The Author(s).

@article{beaulieu_2016,
	Abstract = {The distribution of diversity can vary considerably from clade to clade. Attempts to understand these patterns often employ state-dependent speciation and extinction models to determine whether the evolution of a particular novel trait has increased speciation rates and/or decreased extinction rates. It is still unclear, however, whether these models are uncovering important drivers of diversification, or whether they are simply pointing to more complex patterns involving many unmeasured and co-distributed factors. Here we describe an extension to the popular state-dependent speciation and extinction models that specifically accounts for the presence of unmeasured factors that could impact diversification rates estimated for the states of any observed trait, addressing at least one major criticism of {Bi\SSE} (Binary State Speciation and Extinction) methods. Specifically, our model, which we refer to as {Hi\SSE} (Hidden State Speciation and Extinction), assumes that related to each observed state in the model are "hidden" states that exhibit potentially distinct diversification dynamics and transition rates than the observed states in isolation. We also demonstrate how our model can be used as character-independent diversification models that allow for a complex diversification process that is independent of the evolution of a character. Under rigorous simulation tests and when applied to empirical data, we find that {Hi\SSE} performs reasonably well, and can at least detect net diversification rate differences between observed and hidden states and detect when diversification rate differences do not correlate with the observed states. We discuss the remaining issues with state-dependent speciation and extinction models in general, and the important ways in which {Hi\SSE} provides a more nuanced understanding of trait-dependent diversification. \copyright The Author(s) 2016.
