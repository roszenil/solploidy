Honest mistakes have been corrected

1. Species that need to be cut due to uncertainty (could be anything so non-informative)

Nierembergia_rigida
Anisodus_luridus  
Lycium_europaeum 
Lycium_chilense
Lycium_ciliatum
Chamaesaracha_coronopus
Chamaesaracha_sordida

Solanum_juvenale
Solanum_hieronymi 
Solanum_campylacanthum
Solanum_discolor   
Mandragora_officinarum # ? sol-traits has SI but not ICDP = ID and CP??

2. Species where Rosana some info about csomes
Nicotiana_undulata - 24 csomes
Jaltomata_auriculata 24 csomes
Solanum_proteanthum - 24csomes 



3. I really don't know what is going on
Hyoscyamus_muticus # Classified as CP but really don't know because csome 28 = Solution it is diploid but still to check Breeding Sytem change to CD
Physochlaina_orientalis # Rosana csome 28, ICDP completely uncertain ?= Solution ID and CD
Lycium_gariepense # ?Rosana csome 24, Emma polyploid = CD and CP 
Solanum_elaeagnifolium  # ? Rosana information of SC in soltraits but not on ICDP? both D/P
Solanum_chenopodinum    # ? Rosana only found 24 csomes but is listed in ICDP as CD and CP?
Solanum_chacoense      # ? Rosana has only 24 csomes but ICDP has 0.8 ID and 0.2 CP ?
Solanum_candolleanum   # ? Rosana has only  24 csomes but ICDP has 0.9 ID and 0.1 CP ?


4. Species that are informative for the three state but are not for neither of the two-state models (ID and CP simultaneously)
Lycium_californicum 
Solanum_bulbocastanum


5. Species that Rosana needs to correct by hand (automatic processing fails)
Lycium_exsertum # This I need to correct by hand it is D/P but always SC
Datura_metel    # This I need to correct by hand it is D/P but always SC
Withania_somnifera  # This I need to correct by hand it is D/P but always SC

Solanum_colombianum  # This I need to correct by hand it is D/P but always SC
Solanum_torvum       # This I need to correct by hand it is D/P but always SC
Solanum_capsicoides  # This I need to correct by hand it is D/P but always SC
Solanum_pectinatum   # This I need to correct by hand it is D/P but always SC
Solanum_dioicum      # This I need to correct by hand it is D/P but always SC
Solanum_cinereum       # This I need to correct by hand it is D/P but always SC

5. Processing mistakes (ignore there this is something about my code)
Petunia_scheideana 
Petunia_saxicola  
Lycianthes_rantonnetii  # Weird processing error, need to correct to ID
Capsicum_cardenasii     # Weird processing error, need to correct to ID
Witheringia_meiantha    # Weird processing error, need to correct to ID
Solanum_stipuloideum    # Weird processing error need to correct to ID
Solanum_cyaneopurpureum # Weird processing error should be CD
